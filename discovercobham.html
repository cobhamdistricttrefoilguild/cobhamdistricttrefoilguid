<h1>Cobham Trail</h1>
<p>
Welcome to the home page of Cobham Trail which has been devised by Cobham Trefoil Guild to celebrate 
the centenary of Cobham Guides.  However, we are inviting everyone to come and try it out.
</p>
<p>
The trail is a circular walk of approximately 3.5 miles, which starts and finishes at Cobham and 
Stoke D'Abernon Railway Station.  The walk will take you along either pavements or footpaths so there 
is no danger of getting muddy feet!  While walking the route, you are asked to answer clues which 
need to be added to an answer grid in order that you can solve the final quiz.

            The trail will take you through the villages of both Stoke D'Abernon and Cobham and you 
            will pass the pubs of The Old Plough, The Bear and The Running Mare as well as a variety 
            of coffee shops so there is ample opportunity for a well earned break.

            past the famous Cobham Mill, through the conservation area of The Tilt and into Cobham Cemetery
